# JojoBin 

## Description:
Collection of all cmd core/windows utils I use on a daily basis. 

## Why?:
Ive been making small doskey macros since 2018, and I wanted to have a central place to store them and track them over the coming years. 

## Note:
All off these are personal/have a lot of pre-reqs behind it, and so probably cannot be used on your system directly. It is mainly a reference for me to look back on/track.
